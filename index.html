            I work at Zage a company making transactions cost nothing. I enjoy
            theoretical physics, football(soccer), photography, and climbing. I'm trying to climb V10 by the end of 2022.
            I watch all my youtube videos at 2x speed. I wrote my first line of code in 2014; I
            was trying to replicate voices in real-time, and I finally figured out how to do it in 2021. 
            I like sushi. I think we should teach babies deep learning. My only goal in life is 
            to open a school. Everything else is in service of that.
