            I'm currently doing Physics Informed Neural Networks research. I enjoy
            robotics, theoretical physics, football(soccer), and photography. I watch
            all my youtube videos at 2x speed. I wrote my first line of code in 2014; I
            was trying to replicate voices in real-time, I finally figured out how to do
            it in 2021. I'm very worried about taxes. I like sushi. I think we should
            teach babies deep learning.
